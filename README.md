*Families* identifies family and kin relationships in a virtual population
generated by *VirtualPop*. Individual identification
numbers (IDs) are the keys to retrieve information on individuals and
relationships. The package includes a few basic functions to navigate
the virtual population database. They retrieve information on mothers,
fathers, partners, children, siblings, aunts, uncles and cousins. They
also retrieve information on grandparents, great-grandparents and their
offspring. The individual information is limited to date of birth, date
of death, and IDs of partner, mother, father and children.

The multi-generation virtual population offers opportunities to map
social (family) networks and to adopt different perspectives on
population, including the perspective of a child or an elderly person.
The vignette *Families\_Virtual* describes
the package and illustrates its use. HTML and pdf versions of the
vignette are in folder *Families/doc*.
