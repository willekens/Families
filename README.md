# Families
Family relationships in a virtual population
$Families$ identifies family and kin relationships in a virtual population generated by $VirtualPop$. Individual identification numbers (IDs) are the keys to retrieve information on individuals and relationships. The package includes a few basic functions to navigate the virtual population database. They retrieve information on mothers, fathers, partners, children, siblings, aunts, uncles and cousins. They also retrieve information on grandparents, great-grandparents and their offspring. The individual information is limited to date of birth, date of death, and IDs of partner, mother, father and children. 

The multi-generation virtual population offers opportunities to map social (family) networks and to adopt different perspectives on population, including the perspective of a child or an elderly person. The vignette $Families\_Virtual$  describes the package and illustrates its use. HTML and pdf versions of the vignette are in folder $Families/doc$. 

You should be able to install VirtualPop using the following R code: 
```{r}
        library(devtools)
        devtools::install_github("willekens/Families")
```
